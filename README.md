# Just a simple thing to encrypt and decrypt files with a password.

## Might not be the best way to do it, but it works for me.

Made with Java SE 17.

## Usage:

```bash 
java -jar encryption.jar <mode> <filename>
```

## Modes:

- encrypt
- decrypt

### For decryption, the filename must be `<filename>.enc`, otherwise the decryption will not work.
